1. What has been your experience learning bash?
	I've honestly struggled with bash a lot since coding and scripting aren't things I'm very good at. It's frustrating, which is true with a lot of cyber-related topics. 

2. What would have made the experience with learning it better, if there were problems with it, my instructions, or the assignments?
For me, the videos walking us through the code really helps me understand what each segment is supposed to do. I'd also probably benefit from step-by-step sort of documents with photos, but I like the way it's taught now. It allows me to be a bit more independant and do the work when I feel like I have the capacity to.

3. Approximately how much time did you spend working on assignments?
It varies from assignment to assignment. This one didn't take me long, maybe about an hour or so, but most take me a couple of hours at least. They usually don't take me more than three unless I'm struggling with a section of it more than usual.

4. Are you able to see how the programs used in the class or learning bash would be helpful for your career?
Yes. A lot of cyber-related jobs have scripting involved and one of my current classes also requires some knowledge of bash. It's used in a lot of areas, so it's good for me to know.
